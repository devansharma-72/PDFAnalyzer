# PDF Analyzer Bot

PDF Analyzer Bot is an innovative project designed to leverage the Gemini API and LangChain for advanced document analysis capabilities. This project enables advanced parsing, insightful analysis, and streamlined data extraction from PDF documents.

## Project Files

- `app.py`: The main application file that runs the PDF Analyzer Bot.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of all the dependencies and libraries required to run the project.
